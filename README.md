# Effect of Transcranial Stimulation on Anxiety

This study investigates how tACS stimulation may affect neural activity and behavior in anxious vs. non-anxious participants. 
The Task Phase consists of a 10-minute Foraging Game, divided into two parts:
- Fast Foraging (5 min): Participants search and collect rewards quickly.
- Slow Foraging (5 min): Participants perform the same task at a slower pace.

We compare different features extracted from EEG data recorded during resting states and gameplay, both before and after stimulation.
